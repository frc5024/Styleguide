# Styleguide

## C++
The following section outlines how to style C++ code

### Functions
When writing a function, there are a few important things that must be done to keep the code clean and uniform.

#### Naming
The name of a function must be very descript of what it does, or returns. Every word in the function name must also be uppercase. For example:
```
ClimbScale() // Good

DoTheThing() // Bad. Not descriptive

getStuff() // Bad. Not uppercase
```
